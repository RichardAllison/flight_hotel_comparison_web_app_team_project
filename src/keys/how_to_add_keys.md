To run please create files in this folder named:

<!-- below was not used in the end for live data, though it was used to get
a list of all airport and city IATAs - very helpful!-->
<!-- * aviation-edge-iata-api.js
 * (for holding the key for https://aviation-edge.com/) -->
* amadeus-comparison-api.js
  * (for holding the key for https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog)

Then create a variable, assign it your key for that site as a value and module.exports that variable.
